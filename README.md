# editDistanceDP
Solve the Edit Distance problem using Dynamic Programing. I used 2 different text files to compare words from each file. 

You can test the program with 2 files provided in the repository. "pequeño" contains 9 words and "mediano" ("mediano1") contain 100 random words that were generated by a website. 

pequeño: It took [4.12931] seconds to find the distance for every possible word

mediano: It took [1550.62264] seconds to find the distance for every possible word
